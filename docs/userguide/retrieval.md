# Data Retrieval

Now that you've sent some data, how do you see it (in a user friendly way). 

WattDepot has two ways to view the measurements in the depositories.

1. Using the WattDepot Single Page Application (SPA).

2. Using the **Logs / Information / Summary** tab in the WattDepot administration user interface.

## WattDepot SPA

The WattDepot SPA is an HTML and JavaScript based application for viewing the measurement data from 
a WattDepot server.  WattDepot-SPA is an attempt to create a seamless single page application 
interface for data queuing and viewing. Built using the Twitter Bootstrap we hope to create a sleek 
and elegant interface that not only looks good on a desktop, but smart phones as well.

Figure 1. Shows an example of the visualization of Power consumed by two different Sensors.

You can open the WattDepot SPA by navigating to &lt;host&gt;/spa/.

## Logs / Information / Summary tab

*This feature is not yet implemented.* It will provide a simple access to the server logs, information
about the measurements, and a summary of the data stored.
