# Downloading sources

The WattDepot source code and documentation are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), and are managed using [Git](http://git-scm.com/), which you should have installed as part of the [Prerequisites](/wattdepot/developerguide/prerequisites). You can clone the repository to your local system using either the command line or a GUI tool:

## Command line

    $ git clone https://github.com/wattdepot/wattdepot.git

## GUI and IDE

WattDepot's Git repository may be accessed using many different [client programs and plug-ins]
(http://git-scm.com/downloads). As mentioned in the [Prerequisites](/wattdepot/developerguide/prerequisites), we like the free clients provided by GitHub: [GitHub for OS X](http://mac.github.com/) and [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/). On the [WattDepot project page](https://github.com/wattdepot/wattdepot) there should be a button labeled "Clone in Desktop" that will automatically launch your GitHub client and start the clone operation.

# Contributing to WattDepot

If you plan to submit changes back to WattDepot, rather than cloning the WattDepot repository, you should first fork the repository on GitHub, and then clone it to your local system. This way, you can submit pull requests for bugs or new features that you add. First you will need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one already, and then follow the wonderful [GitHub forking tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). You can read more about [pull requests at GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
